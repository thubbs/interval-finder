# Interval finder
Find evenly spaced intervals between two numbers. I use this for filling in blanks in a weight tracking spreadsheet!

## User controllable variables

*  _start_ - starting value to find intervals from
* _end_ - end value to find intervals from. Will not be included in output.
* _intervals_ - set how many evenly spaced values between _start_ and _end_ you want to generate. 

Interval values are rounded to one decimal place.
